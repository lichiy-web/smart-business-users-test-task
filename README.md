## Requirements:
1. **Fetch All Users**:
    * Use the endpoint GET /users from JSONPlaceholder to retrieve the list of all users.
Documentation: JSONPlaceholder
2. **Display Users in a Table**:
    * Implement a table with columns: name, username, email, and phone.
3. **Implement Advanced Filtering**:
    * Add search input fields for each column (name, username, email, phone).
    * Ensure that the table dynamically filters results based on user input in these fields,
with real-time updates.
4. **State Management**:
    * Use Redux to manage the application state, including user data and filter states.
You can choose between Classic Redux or Redux Toolkit for this task.
5. **Type Safety**:
    * Apply TypeScript comprehensively across the entire web application to ensure
proper typing and reduce potential runtime errors. This includes all aspects of the
applicationâ€™s functionality.
6. **Design and Styling**:
    * Design the table and search inputs to be user-friendly and visually appealing. The
styling is up to you, aiming for a clean and effective user interface.
